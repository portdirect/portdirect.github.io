                            The industry standard open source platform for cloud computing. Originally founded in 2010 by Rackspace and NASA as a collection of
                            software projects to develop and manage cloud infrastructure in a data center, it enables Infrastructure as a service (IAAS). OpenStack
                            can provide an open and flexible vendor agnostic framework that many large enterprises have adopted as the underlying technology to
                            drive transformation to software-defined infrastructure and support their business operations. Users cite significant competitive
                            advantage from OpenStack with dramatically reduced provisioning times from weeks or months to minutes, and freedom from being locked in
                            to proprietary systems.
