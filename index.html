                        An orchestration system for describing a cloud application by executing appropriate API calls to generate running applications. Compatible with AWS Cloudformation, and OpenStack APIs, a Heat template describes the infrastructure for a cloud application in text files which are readable and writable by humans, and can be managed by version control tools. Templates specify the relationships between resources (e.g. this volume is connected to this server). This enables Heat to call out to the OpenStack APIs to create all of your infrastructure in the correct order to completely launch your application. The software integrates other components of OpenStack. The templates allow creation of most OpenStack resource types (such as instances, floating IPs, volumes, security groups, users, etc), as well as some more advanced functionality such as instance high availability, instance auto-scaling, and nested stacks.

The project is owned and powered by a diverse set of contributors, and is part of the Linux Foundations Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for containers, handling scheduling of applications onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively managing workloads to ensure that their state matches the users’ desires. It provides a simple and resilient “platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts”.

                        Distributed applications consist of many small applications that work together. Docker transforms these applications into individual containers. Swarm provides native clustering for Docker, turning a pool of hosts into a single, virtual Docker host. Instead of having to build, run and manage each individual container, Docker Compose allows you to define your multi-container application with all of its dependencies in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command.

By moving the security perimeter to surround each component within your system, and allowing you to quickly and easily secure individual devices, containers and applications, rather than the just the edges of your network, you can both significantly increase the strength of your system to attack, accidental data exposure, while gaining valuable insight into the exposure and interactions of your systems. Powerful API driven access control, identity federation, authentication and authorization makes taking a holistic approach to your data’s security and integrity effortless, allowing you to concentrated on processing data, and delivering experiences to your customers, without fear of exposure.
</p><p>
Port.Direct powerful identity management platform, allows you to authenticate and authorize users and services across different platforms and systems without having to create separate accounts for each one. By providing Single Sign on, with both Role and Host based access controls and supporting a range of Federation protocols (including Security Assertion Markup Language, Open-ID, Open-ID Connect, and Oauth 2.0 in addition to OpenStack Keystone inter-cloud Federation) allows you securely connect virtually any web enabled application or service. LDAP and Kerberos provide support enable support for legacy applications, Microsoft Active Directory and application specific security requirements.

The core of the Harbor Platform, is an enterprise grade Linux distribution, with a CentOS 7.2 user-land, and the upstream LTS Linux Kernel. Utilizing the OSTree packaging and update system, allows for 'Atomic' updates without risk of incompatibility and the ability roll back to a previous known state, eliminating the cost, hassle and loss of continuity from complex and unpredictable updates. Making extensive use of Kubernetes, Docker, FreeIPA and Systemd, the Marina Cloud Management Suite from Port.Direct makes management, troubleshooting and support simple, while the 'edgeless' approach to networking and security make forming massively distributed repurposeable clusters a credible option for organizations no matter what their scale.

Harbor uses OpenStack, industry standard open source platform for cloud computing, extensivly to provide vendor agnostic storage, networking, hypervisor support, orchestration and end user facing API's. Originally founded in 2010 by NASA and Rackspace as a collection of software projects to develop and manage cloud infrastructure in a data center. OpenStack provides an open and flexible vendor agnostic framework that many large enterprises have attempted to adopt as the underlying technology to drive thier transformation to software-defined infrastructure and support their business operations. Those that have succeeded cite significant competitive advantages from OpenStack with dramatically reduced provisioning times from weeks or months to minutes, and freedom from being locked in to proprietary systems.

Harbor uses Kubernetes as the foundation for it the highly available, scalable and flexible architecture. Port.Direct has enhanced the standard Kubernetes feature set by adding support for direct OpenStack Cinder Storage attachment, enabling containers to securely access the data they need from anywhere and provide support for a huge number of proprietary and dedicated storage solutions from hardware vendors including EMC, NetAPP, Fujitsu, and Pure Storage. Networking has been extensively reworked from the simple overlay-networks or routing methodologies offered by Flannel, and Calico to make the most of the advantages that OpenStack Neutron can bring. These include multi-tenant operation, compatibility with other platforms, advanced routing and the replacement of the "Kube Proxy" with an implementation of HA-proxy, improving throughput control and distribution of workloads. These enhancements both significantly improve the viability of Kubernetes as a solution for managing containers on bare-metal infrastructure as well as reducing reliance on public cloud providers offerings for storage and connectivity with the outside world.

                                    Harbor uses OVN, to provide networking, putting users in control over their cloud network resources. This allows users to connect groups of VMs or containers into private L2 and L3 networks, quickly, programmatically, and without the need to provision VLANs or other physical network resources. OVN provides native support for logical switches and routers, security groups, and L2/L3/L4 ACLs, implemented using OpenFlow on top of a Geneve tunnel-based overlay network. Harbor is sufficiently robust and scalable to support large production deployments, and supporting the same virtual machine environments as Open vSwitch, including KVM, Xen, and Hyper-V in addition to both software and hardware gateways.
